    <h1>My Short Story</h1>
    <p>The sketch, by contrast, is intercultural, depicting some phenomenon of one culture for the benefit or pleasure of a second culture. <br>
         Factual and journalistic, in essence the sketch is generally more analytic or descriptive and less narrative or dramatic than the tale. <br> Moreover, the sketch by nature is suggestive, incomplete; the tale is often hyperbolic, overstated. <br>
        The primary mode of the sketch is written; that of the tale, spoken. 
        <br>
        <br> This difference alone accounts for their strikingly different effects. 
        <br>The sketch writer can have, or pretend to have, his eye on his subject.
         <br>
         <br> The tale, recounted at court or campfire—or at some place similarly removed in time from the event—is nearly always a re-creation of the past. <br>
         <br>
          <br> The tale-teller is an agent of time, bringing together a culture’s past and its present. <br>
          <br> The sketch writer is more an agent of space, bringing an aspect of one culture to the attention of a second.</p>
